# README
# 
# In order to [pamperize](https://github.com/leandrosardi/pampa), it must be done at an `account` level.
# That means: each account will run its own planner.
# 
# In order to don't have to manage concurrency on the `shared_addresses` array, shared addresses must be
# assgined to a single accounts during a `leassing period`.

=begin
- How to choose the address when f.sequence_number>1 ?
- How to resolve scalability ?
- Push deliveries to micro.emails.delivery, with the calendars of the campaign.
